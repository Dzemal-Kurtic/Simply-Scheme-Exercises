- SIMPLY SCHEME, EXERCISES -
----------------------------

This project contains my solutions to the exercises presented
at the end of each chapter in the textbook Simply Scheme (Brian
Harvey and Matthew Wright, 2nd ed, MIT 1999).

I have omitted the first two chapters as they are very basic
and contain little or no actual code.

The code samples throughout the book use a slightly modified
implementation of Scheme (syntactically LISP, but with some
additional compound procedures). I have included within this
repository the codebase that the authors provide the reader
to augment their preferred implementation of Scheme.

For the record, I recommend this particular book for anyone who:

0) wants to learn LISP and/or functional programming;
1) finds SICP uses too much abstract mathematics;
2) is looking for a good introduction to programming
