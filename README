- SIMPLY SCHEME, EXERCISES -
----------------------------

This project contains my solutions to the exercises presented
at the end of each chapter in the textbook Simply Scheme (Brian
Harvey and Matthew Wright, 2nd ed, MIT 1999).

I have omitted the first two chapters as they are very basic
and contain little or no actual code.

The code samples throughout the book use a slightly modified
implementation of Scheme (syntactically LISP, but with some
additional primitive procedures). To get this augmentation
working correctly in Dr. Scheme, you must choose "Pretty Big"
from the languages menu and then install the extensions via
the REPL:

> (require (planet dyoo/simply-scheme:1:2/simply-scheme))

I try to only use concepts and procedures that have been introduced
when answering questions (e.g I don't use recursion before it's been
discussed).

For the record, I recommend this particular book for anyone who:

0) wants to (re)learn LISP and/or functional programming;
1) finds SICP uses too much abstract mathematics;
2) is looking for a good introduction to programming
