; Write a procedure sort2 that takes as its argument a sentence containing two
; numbers. It should return a sentence containing the same two numbers, but in ascending
; order:
;
; > (sort2 â€™(5 7))
; (5 7)
;
; > (sort2 â€™(7 5))
; (5 7)

(define (sort2 nums)
  (if (>= (first nums) (last nums))
    (sentence (last nums) (first nums))
    nums))
