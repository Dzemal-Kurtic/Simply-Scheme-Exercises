; What does
;
; ((SAN FRANCISCO))
;
; mean in the printout of world-tree? Why two sets of parentheses?


; Answer: It has two sets of parentheses because it's a list with a datum and
;         no children (first pair) and the name of the datum contains more than
;         one word, so it needs to be represented as a list (second pair).
