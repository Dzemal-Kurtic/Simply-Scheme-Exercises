; The expression (+ 8 2) has the value 10. It is a compound expression made up of
; three atoms. For this problem, write five other Scheme expressions whose values are also
; the number ten:
;
; - An atom (0)
; - Another compound expression made up of three atoms (1)
; - A compound expression made up of four atoms (2)
; - A compound expression made up of an atom and two compound subexpressions (3)
; - Any other kind of expression (4)
