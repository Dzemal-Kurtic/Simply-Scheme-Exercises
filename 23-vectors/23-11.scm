; In some restaurants, the servers use computer terminals to keep track of what
; each table has ordered. Every time you order more food, the server enters your order
; into the computer. When you're ready for the check, the computer prints your bill.
;
; You're going to write two procedures, order and bill. Order takes a table number
; and an item as arguments and adds the cost of that item to that tableâ€™s bill. Bill takes a
; table number as its argument, returns the amount owed by that table, and resets the table
; for the next customers. (Your order procedure can examine a global variable *menu*
; to find the price of each item.)
