; Append may remind you of sentence. They’re similar, except that append
; works only with lists as arguments, whereas sentence will accept words as well as lists.
; Implement sentence using append. (Note: The built-in sentence can take any
; number of arguments. First write a version that accepts only two arguments. Then,
; optionally, try to write a version that takes any number. Also, you don’t have to worry
; about the error checking that the real sentence does.)
