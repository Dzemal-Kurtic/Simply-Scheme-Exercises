; Currently, the program always gives the message "argument(s) not in domain"
; when you try to apply a function to bad arguments. Modify the program so that each
; record in *the-functions* also contains a specific out-of-domain message like "both
; arguments must be numbers," then modify functions to look up and print this error
; message along with "argument(s) not in domain."
